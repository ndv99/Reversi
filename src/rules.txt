BASIC RULES
--------------
Each reversi piece has a black side and a white side. On your turn, you place one piece on the board with your color facing up. You must place the piece so that an opponent's piece, or a row of opponent's pieces, is flanked by your pieces. All of the opponent's pieces between your pieces are then turned over to become your color.


AIM OF THE GAME
------------------
The object of the game is to own more pieces than your opponent when the game is over. The game is over when neither player has a move. Usually, this means the board is full.


START OF THE GAME
----------------------
The game is started in the position shown below on a reversi board consisting of 64 squares in an 8x8 grid.


PLAYING THE GAME
-------------------
A move consists of placing one piece on an empty square.


CAPTURE
------------
You can capture vertical, horizontal, and diagonal rows of pieces. Also, you can capture more than one row at once.


TIME CONTROL
----------------
A clock is used to limit the length of a game. These clocks count the time that each player separately takes for making his own moves. The rules are very simple, if you run out of time, you lose the game, and thus must budget your time.


END OF THE GAME
-------------------
The game ends when:
-One player wins, by making his color dominant on the board.
-The players agree to finish the game (as a resignation, or a draw).
